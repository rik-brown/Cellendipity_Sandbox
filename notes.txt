Velocity can be scaled down from unit vector (1) by multiplying with a value in range 0-1

Age can be mapped from 0 to 1000 (not 0 - lifetime)
Cells with shorter lifetime will thereby die at an earlier stage in their colour-lifecycle

Rotation angle (heading) can also have a start and a stop (like size, colour etc)
Heading can be controlled or influenced by noise

Color can be linked to heading (from angle 0 to angle 360?)

All modulated values should be able to both grow and shrink on their journey through life
