Velocity can be scaled down from unit vector (1) by multiplying with a value in range 0-1

Cells with shorter lifetime will thereby die at an earlier stage in their colour-lifecycle

Heading can be controlled or influenced by noise

All modulated values should be able to both grow and shrink on their journey through life
