Cellendipity_Sandbox
====================

Is a generic 'multi-cellular playset'
 - consisting of well-organized, easy-to-understand functional-modules
 - for easy prototyping & documentation of exploratory art-experiments
 RB 09.apr.2017

Stuff I'm currently working on:
===============================
TASKS:
  t-1) Read through the whole code to remind myself how it all works

BUGS:
  b-1) cycleGen & cycleGenSin should be set to =1 if MaxCycles = 1 (can't map in range 1 to 1)

IMPROVEMENTS

  EPIC: SYSTEM CONFIGURATION
  i-1) I can simply and robustly configure the 'output mode' of the system (without having to remember technical stuff)
    * A 'makePDF' mode
    * A 'makeGIF' mode
    * A 'makeMPEG' mode

  i-2) I can simply and robustly configure the 'input mode' of the system (without having to remember technical stuff)
    * A 'Use source image' mode
    * A 'recycle output as source image' mode

  i-3) I can easily select the pattern style (initial spawn) used by the system
    * Manual configuration
    * Automatic (e.g. iterative or random) selection

  i-4) I can easily configure the parameters used to control the result of the artwork
    * Manual configuration
    * Automatic (e.g. iterative or random) selection

  i-5) The configurations I select fall within 'workable ranges' without sacrificing too many interesting outcomes

  i-2) I can easily add to a list of predefined DNA types

  i-3) Change the way I write to logfile to a short generic method which accepts a filename, a string, opens, writes & closes the file
  i-4) Cellendipity_Sandbox.pde generally appears messy & overcomplicated, with all it's counters & filenames. SIMPLIFY!
    * Operations linked to setting up managing the Colony
    * Operations linked to graphical output
    * Operations linked to logfiles

NEW FEATURES:



Stuff I might do in the future:
===============================

BUGS:

NEW FEATURES:
  g) Introduce a new spawn-pattern of concentric rings
    1) Also variable spacing between rows/columns or rings (binomial, sine etc.)

IMPROVEMENTS:
  d) Improve functionality for saving frames for gifs/mp4 videos:
    1) Configurable frame interval

  j) Nucleus should be moved to the DNA
    1) Nucleus colour might need to be hard-coded, to avoid yet more DNA. or?
    2) Same goes for stripe colour

  k) Populate the library with some 'favourite' cell genotypes from older sketches

  m) DNA modifiers need to take spawn-pattern into account (e.g. centered).
    * What are the implications of this?

  v) REFACTORING: rather than size, remoteness, age etc should have "fillcolormodulator" "strokecolormodulator" "sizemodulator" "noisemodulator" "shapemodulator"
    * Each of these can in turn be linked to age, oDist, pixelColor etc.
    * e.g. fill_H = map(fillMod, 0, 1, fill_H_start, fill_H_end) % 360;
    * where fillmod could be map(range, 0, lifespan, 1, 0) or (age, 0, lifespan, 1, 0) etc. MORE ECONOMICAL

  w) Mods in cell() are done to DNA before assignment to parameters, so values remain with the original range

  x) In Genepool: 3) Any new genotypes that might arise during the lifetime of a colony (Why would I want to do this, actually?)
    *  For 3) I need a 'genepool.spawn' function that adds a new genotype to the pool when a new cell is created
    *  It must somehow be linked to the colony.spawn function
    *  It must receive some new DNA and push it to the genepool arraylist
    *  It must be written to the genepool.csv output file
    *  Maybe 'write to .csv' is a function that is called once, at the end of a colony, rather than in the constructor itself?


IDEAS:
  i) Cell STYLE could be a variant of it's DNA, based on a single gene  EXPLORE! Examples could be:
    1) Striped or not  (today handled by having stripe size > lifespan) (which incidentally is a neat way of calculating it)
    2) Stepped or not (maybe stepsize could be managed in a similar way, so "always stepped" but "step interval is double the lifetime")
    3) Show/don't show nucles (again, maybe it's just a question of interval size?)

  l) Try to recreate the twitter/tumblrbot classic styles?

  n) Cell 'gets' it's DNA according to strain ID (which is passed to the cell in a function)

  o) SPAWNING new cells - Add recombined DNA to the genepool?
    * Why would I want to do this? What's the use-case?
    * The genepool is currently only used initially, when seeding a new colony.

    p) Use an image file in /data as a seed for colours (or other parameters) at spawn positions
      1) This reference includes most of what I need: https://processing.org/tutorials/pixels/
      2) Alt.i) When colony spawns a cell, it pulls the colours from image sample (image = colour palette) <DONE AS DEMO 157.1>
      3) Alt.ii) When colony spawns a cell, it does so only in areas of the image having colour X (image =spawn-pattern) <DONE AS DEMO 157.100 & 2>
      4) Add a new class to handle this? Need to think about how to enable this feature.
      5) The output of one iteration could provide the input for the next? <DONE AS DEMO 157.1>
      6) Cell could sample for colour at it's current position for every draw cycle. <DONE AS 157.4>
      6a) Could just use hue while allowing B & S to continue as normal <DONE>
      7) Continue on original path until pixelColor hue is more than X degrees different. If diff>x, adopt new hue & direction

    r) pixelHue at seed position determines initial velocity (direction) (hue is from 0/360, maps to -PI/PI <DONE>
      * Which in turn influences later changes...

    s) pixelHue at current seed position determines heading (or heading offset from initial velocity) <DONE>

    t) (If cell arrives at pixel of a given colour) {do this()} where this = die, spawn, stop moving, etc.

    u) When (cell spawns or splits) {another cell dies}
